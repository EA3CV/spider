UTF-8 Configuration in DXSpider and the Operating System

üåç Why Use UTF-8 in DXSpider and Its Cluster Network

DXSpider exchanges information between nodes across the globe. This includes:

- Operator names and messages.
- Beacon data, DX spots, announcements, and user traffic.
- Exports in JSON, XML, SQL or other modern formats.

Using a universal text encoding ensures full compatibility across all nodes,
regardless of language or operating system.


‚ùå Problems Without UTF-8

Without UTF-8, the following issues may occur:

- Corrupted characters (`ÔøΩ`, strange symbols).
- Loss of accents, special characters (√±, √ß), non-Latin letters or emojis.
- Incompatibility when processing JSON, XML or modern interfaces.
- Inability to properly display Chinese, Arabic, Cyrillic, Japanese, etc.


‚úÖ Benefits of Using UTF-8

Configuring the environment to use UTF-8 enables:

- Correct sending and receiving of all languages.
- Multilingual text display in the console without errors.
- Safe processing of structured files and data.
- Conflict-free operation in international clusters.

UTF-8 is the current standard and supports the full Unicode range, from √°√©√≠√±
to ‰Ω†Â•Ω, ŸÖÿ±ÿ≠ÿ®ÿß, –ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç or üòÑ.


üåê Most Common UTF-8 Locales

Language              Locale UTF-8
--------------------- ----------------
Spanish               es_ES.UTF-8
English (UK)          en_GB.UTF-8
English (US)          en_US.UTF-8
French                fr_FR.UTF-8
German                de_DE.UTF-8
Portuguese            pt_PT.UTF-8
Italian               it_IT.UTF-8
Russian               ru_RU.UTF-8
Chinese (Simplified)  zh_CN.UTF-8
Japanese              ja_JP.UTF-8
Arabic                ar_SA.UTF-8

Important note:
To use another language, simply replace es_ES.UTF-8 with the corresponding
locale.


üë§ Configuring UTF-8 for the sysop User Only

This setup ensures multilingual compatibility for DXSpider without affecting
the rest of the system.

1. Ensure the Locale is Available

As root, edit /etc/locale.gen and make sure your language is enabled. For
example:

	es_ES.UTF-8 UTF-8

Then run:

	sudo locale-gen

2. Configure the Environment for sysop

Edit the file ~sysop/.bashrc:

	nano ~sysop/.bashrc

Add at the end:

	# Spanish UTF-8 locale for sysop
	export LANG=es_ES.UTF-8
	export LANGUAGE=es_ES.UTF-8
	export LC_ALL=es_ES.UTF-8

Optionally, repeat this in ~sysop/.profile to apply it to SSH sessions:

	nano ~sysop/.profile


üñ•Ô∏è Configuring UTF-8 System-Wide

To make UTF-8 the default for all users and services.

1. Enable the Desired Locale (if not already active)

Edit the file:

	sudo nano /etc/locale.gen

Make sure it contains:

	es_ES.UTF-8 UTF-8

Then generate the locales:

	sudo locale-gen

2. Set the Global System Locale

Edit the file:

	sudo nano /etc/default/locale

Recommended content:

	LANG=es_ES.UTF-8
	LANGUAGE=es_ES.UTF-8
	LC_ALL=es_ES.UTF-8

3. Reboot or Log Out

To apply the changes, reboot the system:

	sudo reboot

üîé Verify Active Configuration

After logging in or rebooting:

	locale

You should see:

	LANG=es_ES.UTF-8
	LANGUAGE=es_ES.UTF-8
	LC_ALL=es_ES.UTF-8
	...

You can also check the environment values used by systemd:

	systemctl show-environment


‚úÖ Result

- UTF-8 will be used as the default encoding.
- All users, services, scripts and sessions will correctly display
  international text.
- Interoperability with cluster nodes in any language is ensured.
- Compatible with modern terminals, SSH, screen, tmux, JSON, databases, etc.
